### Welcome to Shelby's GitHub.
In gh-pages, we have _three_ assignments.
**Hehn1** is a project where I created a balloon scene using the p5.js editor.
**HehnLab4** is a project where I created movement, using ellipse shapes, using the p5.js editor.
**HehnLecAssignment8** is a written lecture assignment where I tried out different text fonts plus text formatting. Lecture assignment 8 was _a lot_ of fun!
